# DSSL24 - Engie Data Science Summer Learning

As part of the Engie Data Science series, we got a learning edition with a computer vision model to train & deploy. Goal is to train a model on images of drones, and make bounding box predictions.  
This is a learning edition, so no competition, no swag at the end.
